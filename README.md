This repo holds notebooks for the MN GIS/LIS Consortium Workshop "Introduction to Python for Geospatial Professionals".

The notebooks work best when [run in ArcGIS Online](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/create-a-notebook.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_C30D73392D964D51A8B606128A8A6E8F). If you're not familiar with using Git or GitHub, the easiest way to get these files is to click the Code button above, and choose Download ZIP.
